Maintaining a reliable chain of custody is essential to ensure that the evidence is valid and suitable to support conclusions in a legal context.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "FIT - Freezing Internet Tool is an application for forensic acquisition of content such as web pages, emails, and social media directly from the internet. FIT is a FLOSS tool: an acronym for 'Free/Libre and Open Source Software.' It is a type of software whose source code is made available to the public and can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone, according to the terms of a specific free and open source software license. This means that, compared to proprietary software, FLOSS software offers greater freedom and flexibility to users, who can customize it to meet their needs, improve it, and distribute it without restrictions. Additionally, being open to review by other developers, FLOSS software often benefits from a more transparent and inclusive collaborative development process. FIT has been developed using the Python programming language, implementing a modular architecture. FIT can be downloaded from the following link: {}.<br><br>A forensic browser is software used to analyze and retrieve data from electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, or tablets during forensic investigations. This software allows access to device usage information such as activity history, files and documents, text messages, images, and much more, providing evidence that can be used in a legal case.",
    "HASHD": "File Containing Hashes of Files",
    "HDESCR": "The hash of digital evidence is a unique value that represents digital data and is used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the evidence. A hash is calculated using a one-way cryptographic algorithm that transforms data into a fixed-length character string. If the original data is modified, the hash also changes, making it easy to detect any alterations. In a legal context, the hash of digital evidence is often used to verify that the original data has not been altered during the process of collecting, preserving, and presenting the evidence. Maintaining a record of the hash of digital evidence helps ensure its integrity and ensures that it is suitable to support conclusions in a legal case.",

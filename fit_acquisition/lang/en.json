    "SECTION_DESCRIPTION_FIT_APPLICATION": "FIT Project (Freezing Internet Tool) is a modular suite of applications developed in the Python programming language, designed for the forensic acquisition of online content such as web pages, email communications, and content from social media platforms. The suite consists of independent modules, each dedicated to a specific type of acquisition, which can be run individually or in an integrated manner as part of the overall system.<br>FIT is a FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) tool, whose source code is publicly available and usable in accordance with the terms of the applicable open source license. This feature allows verification of the tool's behavior, as well as its adaptability to the specific operational needs of the forensic context. FIT can be downloaded from the following link: {}.<br><br>In digital forensics, a forensic acquisition tool is software designed for the controlled collection of digital data from information systems or online services, with the aim of documenting content and information relevant for technical analysis or evidentiary purposes. In this context, tools such as FIT make it possible to acquire digital content while preserving its context and related information, making the collected data verifiable and usable in investigative activities, technical consulting, or legal proceedings.",
    "SECTION_TITLE_DIGITAL_FORENSICS": "Digital Forensics",
    "SECTION_DESCRIPTION_DIGITAL_FORENSICS": "Digital forensics is the scientific and technological application of forensic principles to the collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital data in a legal context. This discipline is used to investigate cybercrimes, such as fraud, data theft, or malware distribution, and to recover and analyze information from electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. Digital forensics includes the use of specialized tools to analyze digital data and ensure the validity of evidence in a legal context. The work of digital forensics professionals is crucial in helping investigative agencies and courts identify and punish those responsible for cybercrimes and ensure justice.",
    "SECTION_TITLE_CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY": "Chain of Custody",
    "SECTION_DESCRIPTION_CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY": "The chain of custody is an important concept in forensics that describes the control and documentation of the movement and handling of evidence during an investigation or legal process. The chain of custody ensures that evidence is authentic, unaltered, and uncontaminated, and that its integrity is maintained from the moment it is collected until it is used in court. Maintaining a reliable chain of custody is essential to ensure that evidence is valid and suitable to support conclusions in a legal context.",
    "SECTION_TITLE_HASHES": "Hashes",
    "SECTION_DESCRIPTION_HASHES": "Cryptographic hashes are unique values that represent digital data and are used to verify the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence. A hash is calculated using a one-way cryptographic algorithm that transforms data into a fixed-length string of characters. If the original data is modified, the hash changes as well, making any alteration easy to detect. In a legal context, hashes of digital evidence are often used to verify that the original data has not been altered during the collection, preservation, and presentation process. Keeping a record of hashes helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence and that it is suitable to support conclusions in legal proceedings.",

The WARC format is commonly used in forensic and archival contexts for the structured preservation of acquired web resources, including HTTP requests and responses, multimedia content, and related metadata.<br><br>The WACZ format consists of a compressed archive that includes one or more WARC files, along with indexes and metadata that make consultation and verification easier.<br><br>WACZ files can be viewed using tools compatible with WARC/WACZ standards, such as ReplayWeb.page (https://replayweb.page), which enables local viewing of archived content.",
